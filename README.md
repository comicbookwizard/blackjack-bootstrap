# blackjack-bootstrap
Simple python script to recommend an action in blackjack based on the player's card total and the dealer's face up card. Uses bootstrapping concepts and runs independently.

 I ran it within VS Code, but to run it (assuming you have Python installed):
 1. Run `python BlackjackBootstrapper.py`
 2. ???
 3. Profit.
